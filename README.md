Learning reflection:  This week task really helps me in building my understanding about JavaScript and Vue components. I need to spend more time playing with all Vue components and familiarised myself with JavaScript function in order to implement them on my travel website. 

Task 1: 

In task 1, I learned and applied 4 simple JavaScript functions. Which include, toLowerCase, toUpperCase, includes, and charAt.  

•	toLowerCase: This method is used to convert a string into lowercase letters.

•	toUpperCase: This function transforms the string to uppercase letters.

•	charAt: This function returns the character in a string at a specified index (position). It accepts an argument in the form of an index value.

•	Includes: It examines a string to see if it includes the supplied string/characters.

Task 2:

Task 2 is learned about JavaScript number. I might implement JavaScript number function on my travel website. To get a random number by clicking the button, I applied “function writeRandom()” and passing it to the button function which is “const goButton = document.querySelecor(‘#clickme’)”.

Task 3:

There are two new methods I learned in task 3, which is JavaScript Get and Set methods. In JavaScript Get, I familiarise myself with getFullYear, getDate, getHour. Due to my travel website will have calendar for book a flight or accommodation ticket, I will use getFullYear and getDate for my travel website because the function delivers the year of the provided date.

In JavaScript Set, Use the set function to modify the day of the month for a given Date object depending on UTC time.

Task 4: 

My goal from task 4 is to gain more knowledge about how Vue components work by understand each of the component’s definitions. 

•	A calculated property is a type of method that returns a value every time. It's mostly useful for calculating values from other attributes.

•	Class and style binding: using V-bind to dynamically style HTML page by binding data to an element’s style attribute, as well as its class.

•	Conditional rendering is used to conditionally display elements in Vue. I will use “v-if” and “v-else” to show whether or not a ticket is in stock on my travel website.

•	List Rendering is used to create a list of objects from an array and display it on the website.

•	Event handling is to listen for DOM events that can be used to activate methods. I will use this component under the login form on my website.

•	Form input binding is to utilise forms in Vue to capture user data and to conduct some custom form validation. I will be creating a form that allows user to submit a review of their travel experience under the ‘experience’ section.

•	Components are reusable code pieces that can contain structure as well as functionality. They contribute to the development of a codebase that is more modular and manageable.
